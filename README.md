# ReasonML Resources

## Reference

- [Reason Docs](https://reasonml.github.io/)
-  [ReasonReact Docs](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)

Google isn't indexing the above two at all well as things stand, dead links or GitHub repo come up first.

- [BuckleScript Manual](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html)
Fairly exhaustive guide to BuckleScript. Examples can be lacking slightly. Very technically-oriented.

- [BuckleScript Bundled JS API Reference](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/index.html)
Basic core bindings to JS/DOM/Node. Link hidden in the BuckleScript docs.

- [BuckleScript Build config file (bsconfig.json) schema](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/docson/#build-schema.json)
Config schema, link to which is hidden in the BuckleScript docs.

## Books

OCaml-specific. Use [reason-tools](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-tools) in Chrome/Firefox to convert OCaml code to Reason syntax in-browser.

- [Real World OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org/)
Canonical guide. Uses Jane Street's [Core](https://github.com/janestreet/core) as a stdlib replacement. [Real World OCaml 2 (Beta)](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/) is available and under active development.
